# About me
I'm a Ph.D. student at the Australian National University, working with Associate Professor Megan O'Mara in molecular dynamics. My research focuses on improving various aspects of molecular dynamics research. My solutions range from creating a topology builder for polymers, to looking at neural networks for predicting the potential energy of molecular systems. 

I enjoy teaching, and have been involved chemistry education since 2017. In 2019 I began to take an active role in developing course materials for a computational chemistry course. I am also chair of the chemistry Higher Degree by Research student committee.

I graduated from the Australian National University in 2017 with a [Bachelor of Philosophy](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/APHSC "A Ph.B. is a research-focused undergraduate degree in science.") and first class honours. In 2018 I was the inaugural recipient of the [David and Veronica Craig Scholarship](https://www.anu.edu.au/study/scholarships/find-a-scholarship/david-and-veronica-craig-phd-scholarship), awarded to the highest-ranked student in theoretical, physical, or computational chemistry.
